# Wentwort_Senior_Project_Backlash_System_Malware

The objective of the project was to develop a (amatuer) malware POC using a wormable mechanism to exploit 32-bit Windows 7 machines and implant a persistence mechanism. I am not claiming to have developed everything in this ZIP file, however I included everything for context and completeness.

This ZIP file contains my senior project from Wentworth Institute of Technology. I had a partner on this project, however I performed all development and wrote all code on his and my behalf. I would like to reiterate that I did NOT develop all the files contained, I found other people's work and integrated it into the project for those components that I could not develop myself and credited the respective authors in my presentation. The coding that I did perform is not incredibly advanced or necessarily impressive independently, however I am extremely proud that I was able to compile a complete solution around all components involved and have it work. I modified the eternal_blue exploit, I did not code it. Rkclient is also not mine, that is a kernel driver which was developed by someone else and is used as proof of concept for the resulting persistance mechanism in this project. I developed the Powershell scanner and used a few snippets of other's code I found online (credits given in the file). I created dropper and sub dropper. I have also included the structural diagram for this system, however the system requires a C2 server, a router, and several 32-bit Windows 7 vm's behind NAT to fully illustrate and appreciate the impact. The project was a success and I got an A for it.
